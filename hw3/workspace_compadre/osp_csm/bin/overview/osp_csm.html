<p align="left"><font size="3">The osp_csm.jar Java archive (jar file) contains ready-to-run programs to accompany <i>An Introduction to Computer Simulation Methods </i>
third edition by H. Gould, J. Tobochnik, and W. Christian [Addison Wesley, 2007].&nbsp; The first 
two editions of this text used a procedural language, True Basic, and the programs were designed to be an easy route for 
learning other procedural languages such as Fortran and C.</font></p>

<center>
<p align="left"><font size="3">The third edition uses an object oriented language, Java, which has excellent graphics and user 
interactivity, and is identical on all computer platforms. However, the use of Java makes writing programs more 
difficult than in True Basic, in part because of Java's greater power. Students and teachers now expect to write event 
driven programs with input fields, buttons, and graphical output. For this reason we have written a library of open 
source Java classes that perform much of the routine programming tasks such as input, output, animation, and user 
interaction so that users need not spend much time on these relatively uninteresting tasks.&nbsp; This library is described in 
Chapters 2 and 3 of the book and in greater detail in <i>Open Source Physics: A Users Guide With Examples</i> by W. Christian 
[Addison-Wesley, 2007].</font></p>
