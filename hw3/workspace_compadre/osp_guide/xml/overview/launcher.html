<h1>OSP Launcher</h1>
<p><font size="3">Open Source Physics <b><font color="#800000"><i>Launcher</i></font></b> is a Java application that can execute (launch) other Java programs. We use Launcher to organize and distribute 
collections of ready to run programs, documentation, and curricular material in a single easily modifiable package.</font></p><p>
<font size="3">Executing a Java archive (jar file) starts an instance of Launcher containing curricular material as described in 
Open Source Physics Guide. Double-clicking on a leaf-node in the Launcher's left-hand &quot;tree&quot; launches a Java application. The 
right hand panel shows html-based documentation for the given program. The following launcher packages are available on the OSP CD 
and from the OSP website:</font></p><ul>
  <li><b><font size="3">osp.jar </font></b><font size="3">contains the Open Source Physics code library.&nbsp; Because this 
  archive's manifest executes Launcher, it can be used with almost any Java application using an external xml file that specifies 
  additional jar files.</font></li>
  <li><b><font size="3">osp_guide.jar </font></b><font size="3">is self-contained archive that demonstrates how to use the OSP 
  code library from <i>Open Source Physics: A Users Guide With Examples</i> by Wolfgang Christian.</font></li>
  <li><b><font size="3">osp_demo.jar</font></b><font size="3"> is a self-contained archive of advanced physics curricular material 
  by Mario Belloni.</font></li>
  <li><b><font size="3">osp_csm.jar </font></b><font size="3">is a self-contained archive of examples from <i>An Introduction to 
  Computer Simulation Methods</i> third edition by Harvey Gould, Jan Tobochnik, and Wolfgang Christian.</font></li>
