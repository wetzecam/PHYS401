<h1>Authoring with LaunchBuilder</h1>
<p><font size="3">Launcher configurations, application data, and associated documentation are organized using an Extensible Markup 
Language (xml) text file named launcher_default.xset. Although this file is packaged inside the Java archives on the OSP CD, it 
can also be distributed in an external &quot;zip&quot; archive or as a stand-alone file. Launcher searches for external configurations in 
the directory from which Launcher was executed. Because external configurations can be modified without recompiling code or 
rebuilding jar files, teachers and authors can adapt Open Source Physics curricular material for their own needs or author their 
own curricular material.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Although Launcher configuration xml files can opened with any text editor, they are most easily created and 
edited using the <font color="#800000"><b>LaunchBuilder</b></font> program. Select the <b>Edit</b> menu item under the Launcher 
frame's <b>File</b> menu to explore the capabilities of LaunchBuilder.</font></p>
