<h1>Running Launcher</h1>
<p><font size="3">The pane on the left is an Explorer pane (for navigation and organization), while the pane on the right is the 
Description pane. Note also there are tabs at the bottom of the Launcher window that can change what is displayed in the panes. 
These tabs often refer to a collections of materials we have developed as described in Chapter 15,&nbsp; <i>&quot;Authoring 
Curricular Material,” </i>in the book<i> Open Source Physics: A User’s Guide with Examples</i>. [See W. Christian, Addison Wesley, 2007.]</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The Overview tab gives an overview of the materials contained in this demo. The Instructor Resources tab gives 
an instructor’s view of the material. The Student Exercises tab shows the curricular material. The Help tab contains some help 
files associated with the programs used in this demo. For simplicity there are only three curricular units in this demo: classical 
orbits, radiation from point charges, and quantum-mechanical superpositions. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">To launch a particular piece of curricular material, navigate to a launchable (executable) node, one with a green arrow. 
Double-click that arrow and a program will launch. For example, navigate to the Student Exercises tab, and open up (single-click) 
the Classical Mechanics folder. Open the 4- and 5-body Orbits folder and double-click the first orbit. You should see the figure 
below. Click the “Run” button to see this Montgomery-type orbit animated. To move on to something else, simply close this program, 
and select another node.</font></p><p align="center"><img border="0" src="orbit.jpg"></p>
